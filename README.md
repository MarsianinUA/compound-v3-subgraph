# Compound v3 Subgraph
# Subgraph for CometDeployed Event

This repository contains a Subgraph that tracks the CometDeployed event and extracts important data such as:  
**utilization** - utilization factor.  
**updatedAt** - time stamp of the last update.  
**borrowRate** - borrow rate.  
**supplyRate** - supply rate.  

Subgraph interacts with the blockchain to efficiently track and retrieve the values of these parameters at each CometDeployed event, allowing developers and users to easily integrate up-to-date data into their applications.
